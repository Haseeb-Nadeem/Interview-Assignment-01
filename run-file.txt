Running the Vue.js Project Locally
This guide will walk you through the steps to run the Vue.js project locally on your machine. Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.

Prerequisites
Node.js (includes npm)

Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/Haseeb-Nadeem/Interview-Assignment-01.git
Replace <repository-url> with the URL of your project's repository.

Step 2: Open project using VScode

Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install project dependencies using npm:
npm install

Step 4: Run the Development Server
Run the development server to compile and serve the Vue.js application locally:
npm run dev
This command will start a development server and provide a URL where you can view your Vue application in a web browser.

Step 5: View Your Vue Application
Open a web browser and navigate to the URL provided by the development server. By default, the URL is usually http://localhost:8080.

Additional Commands
npm run build: Builds the Vue.js application for production.
npm run lint: Lints and fixes files.
